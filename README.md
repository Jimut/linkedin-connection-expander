# Linkedin Connection Expander

Automatically sends connection requests to suggested users from your Linkedin profile.

The project is based on Selenium. By default it opens up safari and logs in to your Linkedin profile by the credentials you provide and sends the specified requests contiguously.

## Pre-requisites

1. NodeJS and NPM.
2. Your favorite browser's Selenium driver must be in your PATH variable.

N.B.: Test out Selenium before running this.

## Installation

1. Git clone the repo.
2. Run `npm i`
3. Rename `creds.example.js` to `creds.js` and fill in the informations there.
4. Optional: Configure the `index.js`.
5. Run `npm start`

N.B. Do not move your mouse or press any keys during the automation process, or it will stop the process.
